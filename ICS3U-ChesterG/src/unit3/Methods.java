    /*
    Methods help you modularize a program by separating its tasks into self-contained units.

    Pros:
    - Written only once â€“ no repeated code
    - Methods can be reused (invoked, called) from several locations in a program
    - Divide and conquer approach - Constructing programs from small, simple pieces
    - Software reusability - Use existing methods/classes as building blocks to create new programs.
    - Dividing a program into meaningful methods/classes makes the program easier to debug and maintain.

/**
  Part 2 - Parts of a method
  a) You notice the javadac comment above the method - this explains what the method is doing, if it has any input, and if it has any output
  b) public -> means this method is useable anywhere
  c) static -> means this method acts like a function - there are no "things" using the method
  d) int -> the value that is gotten as a result of the method; the *return value*
  e) doubleNumber -> the name of the method; how we will be able to use it in the code
  f)int num -> the values we need in order for the method to work, and what we will call it in the method; the *parameter*
      the *parameter* -> what the name of the variable which will hold the value is
      the *argument* -> the actual value that is passed into the method
*/

/**(a)
 * This method takes an integer and returns two times its
 * original value
 * @param num - a number to be doubled
 * @return int - a value that was double its original given value

//(b)   (c)    (d)     (e)                 (f)
public static int doubleNumber(int num) {
  int returnValue = num * 2;
  return returnValue; //sends the information back to be used

  Part 3 - Create your method
*/
/*
  Create a method that has 2 int as parameters, and returns the larger one. The name of the method is larger.
