        //Implicit Casting (Widening): Automatically converts a smaller data type (int) to a larger data type (double).
        //'num' is an int, and it is automatically cast to double when assigned to 'numDouble'.
        //This preserves the numeric value but changes the type to double, allowing it to hold decimal points if needed.
        int num = 42;
        double numDouble = num; // 42 becomes 42.0
        System.out.println("Implicit casting: int " + num + " to double is " + numDouble);


        //Explicit Casting: Converts a larger data type to a smaller data type.
        //Here, 'pi' is a double with a decimal value. When cast to int, the decimal part is truncated, and only the integer part is kept.
        //This type of casting must be done explicitly to avoid data loss.
        double pi = 3.14;
        int piInt = (int) pi; // 3.14 becomes 3
        System.out.println("Explicit casting: double " + pi + " to int is " + piInt);
